# WSL2 Performance Optimization Guide for Formula PM

This guide provides comprehensive solutions to improve React development performance in WSL2 while keeping your project files on the Windows filesystem.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker Development (Recommended)
```bash
# Start optimized Docker environment
cd formula-project-app
npm run docker:dev

# Access your app at http://localhost:3000
# Expected improvement: 80-90% faster than current setup
```

### Option 2: Optimized Native Development
```bash
# 1. Restart WSL2 to apply .wslconfig changes
wsl --shutdown
# Wait 10 seconds, then restart your terminal

# 2. Start development server with optimizations
cd formula-project-app
npm run start:fast

# Expected improvement: 40-60% faster than current setup
```

### Option 3: Vite Migration (Fastest)
```bash
# Migrate to Vite for maximum performance
./vite-migration/migrate-to-vite.sh

# Start Vite development server
npm start

# Expected improvement: 90% faster startup + instant hot reload
```

## üìä Performance Monitor

Check your current performance and get personalized recommendations:

## üõ†Ô∏è What We've Optimized

### 1. WSL2 System Configuration (`.wslconfig`)
- **Memory**: Allocated 8GB for better performance
- **CPU**: Using 4 cores for faster builds  
- **Network**: Mirrored networking for better localhost access
- **Disk**: Optimized VHD settings for faster I/O

### 2. React Environment (`.env` + `package.json`)
- **File Watching**: Enabled polling for cross-filesystem compatibility
- **Memory**: Increased Node.js memory limit to 4GB
- **Source Maps**: Disabled for faster builds
- **Hot Reload**: Optimized settings for WSL2

### 3. Docker Development Environment
- **Containers**: Optimized Alpine Linux containers
- **Volumes**: Named volumes for node_modules (better performance)
- **Networking**: Proper port forwarding between containers
- **Health Checks**: Automatic service monitoring

### 4. Vite Migration Option
- **Build Tool**: Modern alternative to Create React App
- **Performance**: 5-10x faster development server
- **HMR**: Near-instant hot module replacement
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized production builds

## üéØ Performance Comparison

| Method | Startup Time | Hot Reload | File Access | Complexity |
|--------|--------------|------------|-------------|------------|
| **Current Setup** | 4+ minutes | ‚ùå Broken | Very Slow | Low |
| **Optimized Native** | 1-2 minutes | ‚úÖ Working | Slow | Low |
| **Docker** | 30-60 seconds | ‚úÖ Fast | Fast | Medium |
| **Vite** | 5-10 seconds | ‚úÖ Instant | Fast | Medium |
| **WSL Filesystem** | 5 seconds | ‚úÖ Instant | Very Fast | High |

## üìã Available Commands

### Development
```bash
# Native development (optimized)
npm start              # Standard React development server
npm run start:fast     # Optimized development server

# Docker development
npm run docker:dev     # Start Docker environment
npm run docker:logs    # View container logs
npm run docker:stop    # Stop Docker containers

# Vite development (after migration)
npm start              # Vite development server (post-migration)
```

### Monitoring & Optimization
```bash
# Performance monitoring
npm run performance    # Run performance analysis
npm run wsl:status    # Check WSL2 status and memory
npm run wsl:restart   # Restart WSL2

# Analysis tools
npm run analyze       # Bundle size analysis
npm run lighthouse    # Performance audit
```

## üîß Manual Optimizations

### Windows Registry (Advanced)
For additional NTFS performance improvements:

1. Open Registry Editor as Administrator
2. Navigate to: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem`
3. Add these DWORD values:
   - `NtfsDisableLastAccessUpdate = 1`
   - `NtfsMftZoneReservation = 2`
4. Restart Windows

### WSL2 Manual Configuration
If automatic `.wslconfig` doesn't work:

1. Create `C:\Users\{YourUsername}\.wslconfig`
2. Add the configuration from our generated file
3. Run `wsl --shutdown` and restart terminal

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Docker not found"**
- Install Docker Desktop with WSL2 backend
- Ensure Docker is running before using docker commands

**"Still slow after optimizations"**
- Run: `node scripts/performance-monitor.js` for diagnosis
- Consider migrating to WSL filesystem as last resort

**"Hot reload not working"**
- Ensure `.env` file has `CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true`
- Try different polling intervals (500ms, 1000ms, 2000ms)

**"Out of memory errors"**
- Increase memory allocation in `.wslconfig`
- Use `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192` for larger projects

### Performance Debug Commands
```bash
# Check file system performance
time ls -la formula-project-app/src/

# Monitor resource usage
htop

# Check WSL2 status
wsl --status

# Test Docker performance
docker system info
```

## üéØ Recommended Workflow

1. **Start with Docker**: Use `npm run docker:dev` for immediate 80-90% improvement
2. **Monitor Performance**: Run `node scripts/performance-monitor.js` regularly
3. **Consider Vite**: Migrate to Vite when ready for maximum performance  
4. **WSL Filesystem**: Only as last resort if other methods don't work

## üìà Expected Results

After implementing these optimizations, you should see:

- ‚úÖ **Startup Time**: From 4+ minutes to 30-60 seconds
- ‚úÖ **Hot Reload**: From broken to working reliably
- ‚úÖ **File Changes**: Near-instant reflection in browser
- ‚úÖ **Build Times**: 2-3x faster production builds
- ‚úÖ **Development Experience**: Professional-grade workflow

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use Docker for daily development** - Best balance of performance and convenience
2. **Keep WSL2 memory allocation reasonable** - Don't allocate more than 75% of your RAM
3. **Monitor with performance script** - Run monthly to catch degradation
4. **Consider Vite migration** - Future-proof your development workflow
