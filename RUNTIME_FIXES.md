# Runtime Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Authentication API 404 Errors
**Problem**: API calls were hitting `/api/api/auth/verify` (double `/api/`) and getting 404 errors.

**Root Cause**: 
- Vite dev server proxy forwards `/api/*` requests to backend on port 5014
- AuthService was using `http://localhost:3003` as baseUrl 
- This caused double `/api/` in URLs

**Solution**:
- Modified AuthService to use empty baseUrl in development mode
- Vite proxy handles the routing to backend automatically
- In production, full API URL is still used

### 2. Environment Variable Issues  
**Problem**: `process is not defined` errors because Vite doesn't provide Node.js globals.

**Solution**:
- Replaced all `process.env.NODE_ENV` with `import.meta.env.MODE`
- Replaced all `process.env.REACT_APP_*` with `import.meta.env.VITE_*` or `import.meta.env.REACT_APP_*`

### 3. Infinite Authentication Loop
**Problem**: Failed API calls caused authentication state to flip between authenticated/unauthenticated, creating infinite redirects.

**Solution**:
- Added graceful error handling in AuthContext
- In development mode, provides demo user when API is unavailable
- Prevents redirect loops when backend is not running

### 4. Import/Export Mismatches
**Problem**: Enhanced components were renamed but import statements weren't updated.

**Solution**:
- Updated all imports from `EnhancedTasksView` → `TasksView`
- Updated all imports from `EnhancedProjectScope` → `ProjectScope`
- Fixed component names and exports to match

## Development Mode Behavior

In development mode, the application now:
1. Uses demo user when backend API is unavailable
2. Routes API calls through Vite proxy to backend
3. Gracefully handles API failures without crashing

## Production Considerations

- Set `VITE_API_URL` environment variable for production API endpoint
- Ensure backend is properly configured for authentication endpoints
- Test authentication flow with real backend before production deployment

## Files Modified

- `src/services/auth/authService.js` - Fixed API URL handling
- `src/context/AuthContext.jsx` - Added error handling and demo user
- `src/hooks/useRealTime.js` - Fixed API URL 
- All files with `process.env` references - Updated to `import.meta.env`
- Component imports - Fixed enhanced component references
