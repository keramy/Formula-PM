      mentionSystem: await this.validateMentionEntities(),
      realTimeUpdates: await this.validateSocketIO()
    };
  }
}
```

### **Performance Validation**
```javascript
// Performance Benchmarks
const performanceTargets = {
  apiResponseTime: 200, // ms for 95% of requests
  databaseQueryTime: 100, // ms for complex queries
  pageLoadTime: 3000, // ms for complete page load
  realtimeLatency: 500, // ms for Socket.IO updates
  concurrentUsers: 50, // simultaneous active users
  memoryUsage: 512, // MB maximum memory per process
  cpuUsage: 70 // % maximum CPU utilization
};

class PerformanceValidator {
  async validateAPIPerformance() {
    const endpoints = [
      '/api/v1/projects',
      '/api/v1/scope',
      '/api/v1/tasks',
      '/api/v1/reports'
    ];
    
    for (const endpoint of endpoints) {
      const results = await this.loadTest(endpoint, 100); // 100 requests
      assert(results.averageResponseTime < performanceTargets.apiResponseTime);
    }
  }

  async validateDatabasePerformance() {
    const queries = [
      'SELECT * FROM projects WHERE company_id = ?',
      'SELECT * FROM scope_items WHERE project_id = ?',
      'Complex JOIN query for project dashboard'
    ];
    
    for (const query of queries) {
      const result = await this.timeQuery(query);
      assert(result.executionTime < performanceTargets.databaseQueryTime);
    }
  }
}
```
