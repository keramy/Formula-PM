## Architecture Overview

### Full-Stack Structure
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express API server with file-based JSON database
- **Frontend**: React 19 with Material-UI components and Context API state management
- **Data Storage**: Custom SimpleDB class managing JSON files in `formula-backend/data/`
- **Communication**: RESTful API with Axios client and localStorage fallback

### Key Technical Components

**Backend (Port 5001)**
- Custom `SimpleDB` class in `database.js` provides ORM-like functionality for JSON files
- Data files: `teamMembers.json`, `projects.json`, `tasks.json`, `clients.json`
- Email service configured with Nodemailer (Gmail SMTP)
- Auto-seeding with 14 Formula International team members on startup
- Complete CRUD API for client database management
- Enhanced project API with filtering support

**Frontend Architecture**
- Material-UI theming with Formula International branding
- `AdvancedDashboard.js` - Analytics with Recharts visualizations
- `GanttChart.js` - Project timeline visualization
- `ProjectsTableView.js` - Professional sortable table with context menus

- Projects link to Clients via `clientId`
- Projects assign to Project Managers via `projectManager`
- Cascading deletes (project deletion removes related tasks)

### API Endpoints
```
/api/team-members    # CRUD operations
/api/projects        # CRUD operations  
/api/tasks          # CRUD operations
/api/clients        # CRUD operations
/api/projects/:projectId/scope  # Scope items CRUD (NEW)
/api/scope/:id      # Individual scope item operations (NEW)
/api/send-notification  # Email notifications
/api/health         # Server status
```

### Environment Configuration
- Backend: `PORT` (default 5001), email credentials for notifications
- Frontend: `REACT_APP_API_URL` (default http://localhost:5001/api)

- Multi-layer protection in UnifiedTableView component
- Status format compatibility (in-progress vs in_progress)
- Comprehensive null safety protection
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

Phases 1-4 of the original project enhancement plan:

**Phase 1: Enhanced Projects List View**
- Professional table view with sortable columns
- Card view toggle for different display preferences
- Context menus with View, Edit, Manage Scope, Delete actions
- Progress bars and status indicators
- Client and manager name resolution

**Phase 2: Advanced Filtering & Search System**
- Real-time search across project names and descriptions
- Multi-criteria filtering: status, type, client, manager, date ranges, budget ranges
- Quick filter presets for common searches (Active Projects, On Tender, This Month, etc.)
- Active filter display with individual clear options
- Collapsible filter panel with filter count indicators

**Phase 3: Excel Export Functionality**
- Professional Excel export with formatted columns
- Multiple sheets: Projects data + Summary analytics
- Status and type breakdowns in summary sheet
- Client and manager name resolution in export
- Timestamp-based filename generation

**Phase 4: Project Scope Management** üÜï

### Database System
The application uses a custom file-based database unsuitable for production. The `SimpleDB` class in `database.js` provides:
- Automatic ID generation with timestamp-based unique IDs
- CRUD operations with error handling
- Data persistence to JSON files
- In-memory caching for performance
- Client database integration with full CRUD support

### State Management Pattern
- Local component state with React hooks
- Global notifications via Context API
- API calls update both backend and local state
- Fallback to localStorage when backend unavailable

### Testing Setup
- React Testing Library configured
- Jest transforms configured for date-fns and MUI date pickers
- No backend tests currently implemented

### Pre-loaded Data
System seeds with 14 Formula International team members including management hierarchy from Managing Partners to technical staff, plus sample Akbank and Garanti BBVA projects. Client database starts empty and is populated through the UI.

### Project Status & Types
**Project Statuses:**
- On Tender (blue) - Projects in bidding phase
- Awarded (green) - Won projects ready to start
- On Hold (orange) - Temporarily paused projects
- Not Awarded (red) - Lost bids
- Active (purple) - Currently in progress
- Completed (dark) - Finished projects

**Project Types:**
- General Contractor - Main construction projects
- Fit-out - Interior finishing projects
- MEP - Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing
- Electrical - Electrical systems only
- Millwork - Custom woodwork and furniture
- Management - Project management services

## UI Styling System

### Modular Theme Structure
The application uses a **modular styling system** that solves Material-UI override issues:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ theme/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js        # Main theme configuration
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ colors.js       # All colors centralized üé®
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ typography.js   # Font styles and sizes
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ components.js   # Material-UI component overrides
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ globals.css     # Global styles with CSS variables
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md       # Complete styling guide
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ App.css            # Legacy styles (still functional)
```

### Easy UI Customization

**Change Colors** (Most common task):
```javascript
// Edit src/theme/colors.js
export const colors = {
  primary: { main: '#37444B' },     // ‚Üê Main brand color
  secondary: { main: '#C0B19E' }    // ‚Üê Accent color
}
```

**Override Components**:
```javascript
// Edit src/theme/components.js
MuiButton: {
  styleOverrides: {
    root: { borderRadius: '20px' }  // ‚Üê Rounded buttons
  }
}
```

**Quick CSS Fixes**:
```css
/* Edit src/styles/globals.css */
.MuiPaper-root {
  background: blue !important;     /* ‚Üê Override anything */
}
```

### Theme Benefits
- ‚úÖ **No more CSS specificity issues** with Material-UI
- ‚úÖ **Centralized color management** in one file
- ‚úÖ **Consistent styling** across all components
