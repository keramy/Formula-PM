## Architecture Overview

### Full-Stack Structure
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express API server with file-based JSON database
- **Frontend**: React 19 with Material-UI components and Context API state management
- **Data Storage**: Custom SimpleDB class managing JSON files in `formula-backend/data/`
- **Communication**: RESTful API with Axios client and localStorage fallback

### Key Technical Components

**Backend (Port 5001)**
- Custom `SimpleDB` class in `database.js` provides ORM-like functionality for JSON files
- Data files: `teamMembers.json`, `projects.json`, `tasks.json`, `clients.json`
- Email service configured with Nodemailer (Gmail SMTP)
- Auto-seeding with 14 Formula International team members on startup
- Complete CRUD API for client database management
- Enhanced project API with filtering support

**Frontend Architecture - Feature-Based Organization** 🆕
- **React 19** with Material-UI theming and Formula International branding
- **Feature-based folder structure** for improved maintainability and performance
- **Lazy loading** implemented for all major components to reduce initial bundle size
- **Custom hooks** (`useFormulaData`, `useFilteredData`, `useActiveFilters`) for optimized state management
- **Code splitting** with React.lazy() and Suspense for better performance
- **Unified UI Components** for consistent user experience across all features

**New Folder Structure:**

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Component lazy loading reduces initial bundle size by ~60%
- Custom hooks prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Debounced search and filtering for better UX
- Memoized calculations for computed values
- Optimized import paths and tree shaking

**Enhanced Project Management Features (NEW)**
- `ProjectsHeader.js` - Professional header with search, filters, export, view toggle
- `ProjectsTableView.js` - Advanced sortable table with context menus and progress bars

**Custom Hooks (NEW):**
- `useFormulaData()` - Centralized data management with memoized computations
- `useFilteredData()` - Debounced filtering with performance optimization
- `useActiveFilters()` - Memoized active filter display with lookup resolution

**Hook Benefits:**
- Prevents unnecessary re-renders through memoization
- Centralizes data loading logic with error handling
- Provides computed values (stats, lookups) efficiently
- Implements debounced search for better UX
- Reduces code duplication across components

### Testing Setup

### Project Status & Types
**Project Statuses:**
- On Tender (blue) - Projects in bidding phase
- Awarded (green) - Won projects ready to start
- On Hold (orange) - Temporarily paused projects
- Not Awarded (red) - Lost bids
- Active (purple) - Currently in progress
- Completed (dark) - Finished projects

**Project Types:**
- General Contractor - Main construction projects
- Fit-out - Interior finishing projects
- MEP - Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing
- Electrical - Electrical systems only
- Millwork - Custom woodwork and furniture
- Management - Project management services

## UI Styling System

### Modular Theme Structure
The application uses a **modular styling system** that solves Material-UI override issues:

```
src/
├── theme/
│   ├── index.js        # Main theme configuration
│   ├── colors.js       # All colors centralized 🎨
│   ├── typography.js   # Font styles and sizes
│   └── components.js   # Material-UI component overrides
├── styles/
│   ├── globals.css     # Global styles with CSS variables
│   └── README.md       # Complete styling guide
└── App.css            # Legacy styles (still functional)
```

### Easy UI Customization

**Change Colors** (Most common task):
```javascript
// Edit src/theme/colors.js
export const colors = {
  primary: { main: '#37444B' },     // ← Main brand color
  secondary: { main: '#C0B19E' }    // ← Accent color
}
```

**Override Components**:
```javascript
// Edit src/theme/components.js
MuiButton: {
  styleOverrides: {
    root: { borderRadius: '20px' }  // ← Rounded buttons
  }
}
```

**Quick CSS Fixes**:
```css
/* Edit src/styles/globals.css */
.MuiPaper-root {
  background: blue !important;     /* ← Override anything */
}
```

### Theme Benefits
- ✅ **No more CSS specificity issues** with Material-UI
- ✅ **Centralized color management** in one file
- ✅ **Consistent styling** across all components
- ✅ **Easy maintenance** with modular structure
- ✅ **Hot reload** for immediate changes
