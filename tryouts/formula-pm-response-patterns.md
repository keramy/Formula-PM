# Formula PM Response Pattern Examples

## Example 1: Real-time Notifications System

**User:** "Add real-time notifications to the project dashboard with toast notifications and notification center"

**Coordinator Response:**
```
Implementing real-time notification system for Formula PM.

DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS:
- Core Dependencies: notification_service (backend WebSocket foundation)
- Dependent Tasks: notification_ui, notification_center (need service first)
- Independent Tasks: toast_component (can build UI component in parallel)

EXECUTION STRATEGY:
**WAVE 1 (Spawn FIRST - Core Dependencies):**
  1. notification_service: Backend Socket.IO service with Prisma integration ‚Üí SPAWN IMMEDIATELY
  2. toast_component: React toast UI component with iconoir icons ‚Üí SPAWN PARALLEL

**WAVE 2 (Spawn AFTER Wave 1 Approved):**
  3. notification_ui: Dashboard integration with real-time updates ‚Üí WAIT FOR #1,#2 APPROVAL
  4. notification_center: Full notification center page ‚Üí WAIT FOR #1 APPROVAL

Spawning Wave 1 tasks now. Wave 2 will wait for service approval...

[After Wave 1 completion and evaluation]

## üìã TASK EVALUATION: notification_service

**Score: 95/100** | **Verdict: APPROVE** | **Demo Mode: PASS**

‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- Proper app.locals.prisma usage in routes
- Demo mode with realistic notification data
- Socket.IO integration follows Formula PM patterns

**Decision:** APPROVED - now spawning Wave 2 dependent tasks...
```

## Example 2: Shop Drawings Version Control

**User:** "Implement version control for shop drawings with diff viewer and rollback functionality"

**Coordinator Response:**
```
Implementing shop drawings version control for Formula PM.

DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS:

- Dependent Tasks: version_api, diff_viewer, rollback_ui
- Independent Tasks: version_history_component (UI can be built separately)

EXECUTION STRATEGY:
**WAVE 1 (Foundation + Independent UI):**
  1. version_control_schema: Prisma schema and migration ‚Üí SPAWN IMMEDIATELY
  2. version_history_component: Version list UI with iconoir icons ‚Üí SPAWN PARALLEL

**WAVE 2 (API Implementation):**
  3. version_api: Backend routes for version CRUD ‚Üí WAIT FOR #1 APPROVAL
  4. diff_viewer: PDF comparison component ‚Üí WAIT FOR #1 APPROVAL

**WAVE 3 (Integration):**
  5. rollback_ui: Complete rollback workflow ‚Üí WAIT FOR #3,#4 APPROVAL

Spawning Wave 1 tasks in parallel...
```

## Example 3: Procurement Workflow Automation

**User:** "Create automated procurement workflow with approval chains and vendor management"

**Coordinator Response:**
```
Implementing procurement workflow automation for Formula PM.

[After initial implementation and evaluation]

## üìã TASK EVALUATION: procurement_workflow_engine

**Score: 88/100** | **Verdict: REJECT** | **Demo Mode: FAIL**

‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- Solid workflow engine design
- Proper Prisma integration

‚ö†Ô∏è **Issues:**
- Icon compliance: Used Material-UI icons instead of iconoir-react
- Demo mode: No fallback data when backend offline
- Pattern deviation: Not using CleanPageLayout for approval page

**Decision:** RE-DELEGATING with focus on: iconoir icons, demo mode, CleanPageLayout

Re-spawning task with Formula PM pattern requirements...
```

## Example 4: Team Collaboration Features

**User:** "Add team collaboration with real-time cursors, comments, and activity tracking"

**Coordinator Response:**
```
Implementing team collaboration features for Formula PM.

DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS:
- Core Dependencies: none (all features can work independently)
- Dependent Tasks: none (but will integrate later)
- Independent Tasks: all three features can develop in parallel

EXECUTION STRATEGY:
**WAVE 1 (Parallel Independent Features):**
  1. realtime_cursors: Socket.IO cursor tracking ‚Üí SPAWN IMMEDIATELY
  2. comment_system: Comments with @mentions ‚Üí SPAWN PARALLEL
  3. activity_tracking: User activity service ‚Üí SPAWN PARALLEL

**WAVE 2 (Integration):**
  4. collaboration_dashboard: Unified collaboration UI ‚Üí WAIT FOR ALL WAVE 1

All Wave 1 tasks are independent - spawning simultaneously for maximum efficiency...

[After evaluations]

## üìã TASK EVALUATION: comment_system

**Score: 94/100** | **Verdict: APPROVE** | **Demo Mode: PASS**

‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- Perfect use of SmartTextEditor with mention support

- Proper iconoir-react usage for all icons
```

## Example 5: Material Specs Excel Import

**User:** "Build Excel import for material specifications with validation and mapping"

**Coordinator Response:**
```
Implementing Excel import for material specifications.

DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS:
- Core Dependencies: excel_parser (file parsing foundation)
- Dependent Tasks: validation_engine, mapping_ui (need parser first)
- Independent Tasks: upload_ui (can build uploader separately)

EXECUTION STRATEGY:
**WAVE 1 (Foundation Components):**
  1. excel_parser: Backend Excel parsing service ‚Üí SPAWN IMMEDIATELY
  2. upload_ui: File upload with drag-drop ‚Üí SPAWN PARALLEL

**WAVE 2 (Processing):**
  3. validation_engine: Data validation rules ‚Üí WAIT FOR #1 APPROVAL
  4. mapping_ui: Column mapping interface ‚Üí WAIT FOR #1 APPROVAL
