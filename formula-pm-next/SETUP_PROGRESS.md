   - Created comprehensive improvement plan

2. **Next Level Plan Created**
   - Saved complete reconstruction plan in `/docs/NEXT_LEVEL_APP_PLAN.md`
   - Defined modern tech stack (Next.js 14, TypeScript, Prisma, etc.)
   - Outlined enterprise features and enhancements
   - Created migration strategy with phases

3. **Test Environment Setup Started**
   - Created `formula-pm-next/` directory for enhanced version
   - Set up project structure and documentation
   - Created Docker environment configuration
   - Prepared setup scripts for different approaches

4. **Files Created**
   - `README.md` - Complete setup guide with 3 options
   - `package.json` - Enhanced dependencies configuration
   - `docker-compose.yml` - Development environment
   - `scripts/setup-prototype.js` - Automated setup script
   - `NEXT_LEVEL_APP_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive enhancement plan

### 🔄 In Progress

**Option 2 Selected**: Enhanced Current App (copy of existing app with improvements)

**Next Steps for Tomorrow**:
1. Copy current `formula-project-app` to `enhanced-frontend`
2. Add modern state management dependencies
3. Implement TanStack Query enhancements
4. Add real-time features preparation
5. Set up enhanced development environment

### 💡 Key Decisions Made

1. **Approach**: Option 2 (Enhanced Current App) for safer, gradual improvements
2. **Strategy**: Preserve all existing functionality while adding modern features
3. **Tech Stack**: Keep React 19 + Material-UI, add TanStack Query + Zustand
4. **Timeline**: Gradual enhancement over 1-2 weeks
5. **Risk**: Low risk approach with side-by-side testing
