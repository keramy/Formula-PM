### 3. Data Structure
```
Report
├── Sections (Executive Summary, Work Completed, etc.)
│   └── Lines
│       ├── Description (text)
│       └── Images[]
│           ├── Caption
│           ├── Metadata (dimensions, timestamp)

```

## 🚧 Tomorrow's Tasks

### React UI Components to Create:

   - Section management
   - Template selection
   - Export configuration

2. **LineEditor.jsx** - Line-by-line editor
   - Rich text description
   - Image attachment per line
   - Drag-to-reorder lines

3. **ImageManager.jsx** - Image handling
   - Drag-and-drop upload
   - Image preview gallery
   - Caption editing
   - Delete functionality

4. **ReportPreview.jsx** - Preview component
   - Show formatted report
   - Print-ready layout
   - Export to PDF button

### Integration Tasks:
- Add "Reports" tab to project pages
- Connect to existing project navigation
- Integrate with authentication/permissions
- Add to project breadcrumbs

## 📝 Technical Notes

### Service Methods Available:
```javascript
reportService.getReportsByProject(projectId)
reportService.createReport(reportData)
reportService.addSection(reportId, sectionData)
reportService.addLine(reportId, sectionId, lineData)
reportService.uploadImage(reportId, sectionId, lineId, imageFile, caption)
reportService.getReportTemplates()
```

### Known Issues to Address:
1. **Create Project Button** - Still showing as plus icon
2. **Export Button** - Dashboard export needs debugging

## 🔑 Key Decisions Made
- Line-by-line architecture for maximum flexibility
- Images attached to individual lines, not sections
- Professional report templates for construction industry
- PDF as primary export format with high-quality images

## 📊 Progress Metrics
- **Reports Module**: 40% complete (service layer done, UI pending)
- **Total Features**: 73 planned, 68 completed, 5 in progress
- **Session Duration**: ~2 hours
- **Files Created**: 1 (reportService.js)
- **Lines of Code**: 347

## 🎯 Next Session Goals
