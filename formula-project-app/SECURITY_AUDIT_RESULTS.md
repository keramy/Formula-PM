- ✅ Enhanced JWT verification with additional security claims
- ✅ Updated environment files with security warnings
- ✅ Implemented proper secret validation

**New Security Features**:
```javascript
// Automatic secure secret generation
const jwtSecret = generateSecureSecret('jwt-dev');
const sessionSecret = generateSecureSecret('session-dev');

// Enhanced JWT with security claims
const securePayload = {
  ...payload,
  iss: 'formula-pm',
  aud: 'formula-pm-api',
  iat: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000)
};
```

### 3. Socket.IO Security ✅ HARDENED

**Security Enhancements**:
- ✅ Created `/backend/config/socketio.js` - Comprehensive Socket.IO security
- ✅ Enhanced authentication middleware with secure token verification
- ✅ Implemented rate limiting (100 events per minute)
- ✅ Added origin validation and CORS protection
- ✅ Implemented connection monitoring and automatic cleanup
- ✅ Added input sanitization for all socket events

**Key Security Features**:
```javascript
// Secure connection limits
connectTimeout: 45000,    // 45 seconds
pingTimeout: 60000,       // 60 seconds
maxHttpBufferSize: 1e6,   // 1MB limit

// Rate limiting and monitoring
socketRateLimit(100, 60000); // 100 events per minute
heartbeat timeout: 300000;   // 5 minutes idle timeout
```

### 4. Authentication Middleware ✅ UPDATED

**Improvements**:
- ✅ Updated Socket authentication to use new security config
- ✅ Enhanced error handling with specific error codes
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging for security events
- ✅ Implemented user status validation
- ✅ Added role-based authorization checks

### 5. Environment Security ✅ SECURED

**New Files Created**:
- ✅ `/backend/.env.secure` - Secure environment template
- ✅ Updated `/backend/.env` with security warnings
- ✅ Added comprehensive security configuration options

**Security Warnings Added**:
```bash
# JWT Configuration - SECURITY WARNING: Change these secrets in production!
JWT_SECRET="dev-jwt-secret-2025-highly-insecure-change-for-production-use-only"
SESSION_SECRET="dev-session-secret-2025-highly-insecure-change-for-production-use-only"

## Production Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - [ ] Generate secure JWT_SECRET (64+ character hex)
   - [ ] Generate secure SESSION_SECRET (64+ character hex)
   - [ ] Set NODE_ENV=production
   - [ ] Configure secure database credentials

2. **Security Settings**:
   - [ ] Enable HTTPS (SECURE_COOKIES=true)
   - [ ] Configure proper CORS_ORIGIN
   - [ ] Set TRUST_PROXY=true if behind reverse proxy
   - [ ] Review and enable all security headers

3. **Monitoring**:
   - [ ] Enable security logging
   - [ ] Configure rate limiting for production load
   - [ ] Set up monitoring for failed login attempts

## Security Recommendations
