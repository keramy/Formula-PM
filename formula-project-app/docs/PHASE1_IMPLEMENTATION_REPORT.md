    status: 'active'
  },
  quality: {
    resolution: { width: 4032, height: 3024 },
    fileSize: 3.2,
    format: 'JPEG'
  }
};
```

### Component Integration

- **Project Context**: Integrates with project pages and scope management
- **User Authentication**: Respects current user roles and permissions
- **Data Structure**: Compatible with existing image storage patterns

### Service APIs
- **photoService.uploadPhoto()**: Enhanced upload with metadata
- **photoService.getPhotosByProject()**: Filtered project photo retrieval
- **metadataService.getCurrentLocation()**: GPS coordinate capture
- **metadataService.getProjectLocations()**: Location template management

## üé® User Experience Enhancements

### Professional Interface
- **Material-UI Components**: Consistent with Formula PM design system
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Features degrade gracefully without GPS
- **Accessible Design**: Screen reader friendly with proper ARIA labels

### Workflow Optimization
