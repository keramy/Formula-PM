# Formula PM App Fix Guide

## Problem Analysis
Your app has conflicting build systems:
- Package.json is configured for Vite
- Node_modules contains react-scripts
- WSL2 path resolution issues
- Mixed module resolution causing compilation errors

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Clean Install (Recommended)
```bash
cd C:\Users\Kerem\Desktop\formula-pm\formula-project-app

# Remove node_modules and package-lock
rm -rf node_modules
rm -rf package-lock.json

# Clean install dependencies
npm install

# Try starting with Vite
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: If Still Issues - Remove Conflicting Dependencies
```bash
# Remove react-scripts and related webpack dependencies
npm uninstall react-scripts
npm uninstall @pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin
npm uninstall react-beautiful-dnd  # This library has issues with Vite

# Clean install again
npm install
```

### Step 3: Missing Dependencies for Vite
Add these if missing:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @vitejs/plugin-react vite
```

### Step 4: Start the App
```bash
# Use Vite dev server
npm run dev

# Or if you want it on port 3000 specifically
npm run start
```

## Alternative: Use your start script
```bash
# From the root directory
cd C:\Users\Kerem\Desktop\formula-pm
chmod +x start-app.sh
./start-app.sh
```

## WSL2 Specific Fixes
If you're using WSL2, also run:
```bash
# Clear Vite cache
npm run start:clean

# Or manually clear cache
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
```

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Backend: Working (port 5001)
- ‚ùå Frontend: Failing due to build tool conflicts
- üîß Root cause: react-scripts + Vite conflict + WSL2 paths

## Next Steps
1. Try Step 1 first (clean install)
2. If that doesn't work, proceed to Step 2
3. Your backend is already working fine
4. The app should be accessible at http://localhost:3000 once fixed
