## Technical Implementation Notes

### **Component Architecture Recommendations**
- Follow existing feature-based folder structure in `src/features/`
- Use established patterns from `src/components/ui/` for consistent styling
- Leverage existing API service patterns in `src/services/api/`
- Maintain Material-UI theme consistency throughout

### **Data Structure Extensions Needed**
```javascript
// Project scope items structure
scopeItems: [
  {
    id: string,
    itemCode: string, // Auto-generated with project initials
    name: string,
    description: string,
    category: 'construction' | 'millwork' | 'electrical' | 'mechanical',
    quantity: number,
    unitPrice: number,
    totalPrice: number, // Auto-calculated
    initialCost: number,
    actualCost: number,
    dependencies: {
      shopDrawingApproved: boolean,
      materialSpecApproved: boolean
    },
    createdAt: string,
    updatedAt: string
  }
]

// Approval tracking structure
approvals: [
  {
    id: string,
    itemId: string,
    type: 'shop_drawing' | 'material_spec',
    status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected',
    revisionNumber: number,
    submittedAt: string,
    approvedBy: string,
    approvedAt: string,
    comments: string
  }
]
```

### **Performance Considerations**
- Use existing lazy loading patterns for new components
- Implement memoization for complex calculations (budget deviations, dependencies)
- Leverage existing code splitting structure
- Maintain current bundle optimization strategies

### **Integration Points**
- Connect with existing authentication context for role-based features
- Use established notification system for approval workflows
- Integrate with current team member management for assignments
- Leverage existing export utilities for Excel functionality

## Priority Implementation Order

1. **High Priority**: Dashboard sortable headers and breadcrumb improvements
2. **Medium Priority**: Project list view standardization and Gantt chart integration
3. **High Priority**: Scope management system with Excel import/export
4. **Medium Priority**: Dependencies tracking and approval workflow
5. **Low Priority**: Timeline editor and action button enhancements

## AI Agent Development Guidelines

When implementing these features:
- Follow existing code patterns and component structure
- Use established Material-UI theme and styling conventions
- Maintain current performance optimizations (lazy loading, memoization)
- Ensure proper TypeScript/PropTypes integration where applicable
- Test with existing demo accounts and role-based access controls
- Maintain backward compatibility with current data structures

This analysis provides specific, actionable prompts that align with your existing application architecture and can be implemented systematically by AI agents while maintaining code quality and consistency.
